## Where are Cornellians Going?

Cornell compiles two career reports relevant to us: the [College Outcomes](https://ccs.career.cornell.edu/dash/dashboard_activity) and the [physics department placement report](https://physics.cornell.edu/career-outcomes). The majority of physics majors go on to attend graduate school and obtain a Ph.D. Of the students who went on to attend graduate school, most study a field in the physical sciences and most pursue a Ph.D. Of the students who suoght employment, the three most common sectors they work in are: technology, education, and consulting/professional practice. 

Below are graphs showing data reported by recent graduates since 2016.
