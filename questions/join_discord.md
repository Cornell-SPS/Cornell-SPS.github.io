# Join the Cornell Math & Physics Discord server

The Cornell Math & Physics Discord server is a platform for Cornell students who are interested in math and physics. If you want to meet new people or if you have any questions you would like to ask, please click [this link](https://discord.gg/2yaJsNa4Jz) to join. To access the other channels within the server, you must first join the Cornell University server (this requires a Cornell NetID) and then request verification in the #introductions channel of the Cornell Math & Physics server.

Note: The Cornell Math & Physics Discord is student-run and has no affiliation with SPS.
