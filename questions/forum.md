## Advice for undergrads interested in doing theory in grad school
### Question
What would you generally recommend students interested in theory do in undergraduate, to prepare best for the ultracompetitive theory graduate school admissions? Most students will not be able to even remotely get involved in High Energy theory/Cosmology until third year with advanced mechanics and quantum. Even then, most topics in modern HEP/Cosmo are locked behind GR and QFT, and potentially even String Theory which are not really taught in most undergraduate institutions bar the occasional Intro relativity class. What are some topics of theory research more accessible to undergraduates in this vein. Would participating in experimental HEP or observational cosmology provide similar benefits as compared to directly theory and should this be done? Would graduate schools be willing to take a theory student with almost no theory research in undergraduate and instead with experimental particle research or observational cosmology? Thanking you in advance and would greatly appreciate any advice.

### Answer
Thank you for your detailed and very relevant question. We are currently writing an answer!
