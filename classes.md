# Classes

Here we have a catalog of all the necessary classes and many of the elective classes that Physics majors take. This includes the main sequence of courses required for a Physics major. We have also included information for each class, including course descriptions, prerequisites, testimonials, etc. Some example schedules are listed here - [Which Classes Should I Take?](/resources/which_class.html)


For additional testimonials and course information, see [CU Reviews](https://www.cureviews.org/).


In addition to the main requirements, Cornell students take courses in a wide variety of other fields, the main ones are listed below: Math, Astronomy, CS, and AEP.
