# Particle physics, accelerator physics

Particle and accelerator physics represent the frontiers of our quest to understand the fundamental building blocks of the universe. Researchers in this dynamic field explore the tiniest constituents of matter and the fundamental forces that govern them. By utilizing cutting-edge particle accelerators, scientists accelerate particles to nearly the speed of light, recreating conditions similar to those at the birth of the cosmos. This research has led to groundbreaking discoveries, such as the Higgs boson, and continues to unravel mysteries about the nature of dark matter, antimatter, and the fundamental forces of the universe. Particle and accelerator physics not only expand our knowledge of the universe but also have practical applications in fields like medical imaging and advanced materials science, making it a cornerstone of modern science and technology. Below, you will find opportunities in the Physics Department.
