# Astronomy, cosmology, planetary/earth sciences

Astronomy is the study of bodies and phenomena in space. It includes a wide range of fields, from Cosmology, the study of the beginning and development of the universe, to Planetary Science, the study of the planets and their formation. Astronomy not only involves a high level of physics knowledge from electromagnetism to general relativity, but also a high proficiency in working with massive amounts of data; it also can be highly interdisciplinary, involving knowledge of biology and geology for example. 

Below, you will find opportunities in departments such as Physics, Astronomy, and Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.
