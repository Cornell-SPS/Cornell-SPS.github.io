# Biological Physics

Biological physics is a multidisciplinary study of nature that uses the tools and techniques of physics to living organisms on scales ranging from the molecular to the macroscopic.
While it is a broad field of study, students who are interested might benefit from taking classes that include topics in nanoscale science and fluid mechanics.

Below, you will find opportunities in departments such as Physics and Applied & Engineering Physics.
