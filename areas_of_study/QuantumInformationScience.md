# Quantum information science, quantum materials, optics, lasers

Quantum information science is a field that leverages the use of quantum mechanics in the manipulation and processing of information. By exploiting the unique nature of quantum systems, such as superposition and entanglement, tasks are able to be performed far more efficiently than would be possible with classical computing. Alongside this, quantum mechanics is used to study the properties of materials that don't abide by classical physics, such as superconductors, in which the study of electrons helps reveal the unique properties of these materials. Finally, quantum optics studies how individual photons of light interact with atomic structures. At Cornell, research into quantum phenomena is undertaken in a variety of different fields, all of which can be seen at [Quantum Science and Engineering at Cornell](https://quantum.cornell.edu/research/).
