## Unofficial Cornell Physics Wiki

Welcome to the repository of the Unofficial Cornell CS Wiki! This is a place where members of the Cornell community can share their expertise and experience in all things physics, from class offerings and graduation requirements to research opportunities and extracurriculars.

We would also like to thank the team behind the [Cornell CS Wiki](https://cornellcswiki.gitlab.io) for much of the inspiration behind this website.
