## General Information

The course covers methods in optical and radio astronomy and selected topics in astrophysics. 
Major experiments use techniques chosen from charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging, optical photometry, 
optical spectroscopy, radiometry and radio spectroscopy. Observations use the Hartung-Boothroyd Observatory's 
24-inch telescope and a 3.8-meter radio telescope on the roof of the Space Sciences Building. Course page can be found [here](https://topics.sirtf.com/Astro4410/CourseHandouts).
