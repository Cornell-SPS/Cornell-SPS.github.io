<link rel="stylesheet" href="/main.css">

## General Information

Covers the standard model of particle physics; Introduction to fields and particles and relativistic Quantum Mechanics; Symmetries in physics; Basic introduction to the Feynman diagrams. At the level of Introduction to Elementary Particles by Griffiths or Modern Elementary Particle Physics by Kane

## Prerequisites

PHYS 3316 and PHYS 3318.

## Topics Covered

  - 

## Workload

Weekly problem sets (~6-10 hrs), one open-note take-home prelim, and an open-note take-home final. One or two of the problem sets may be significantly longer than the rest. [Spring 2023]

## General Advice

  - While attendance will not be taken, it is strongly recommended that you go to lecture. The professor will provide lecture notes and a textbook (which he wrote), but some important concepts, Feynman diagrams, and calculations will likely be omitted or missing, so reading alone will not be sufficient for properly learning the material. Grossman's lecturing style is very casual, and he does not like to stand at the board tediously going through every derivation. He will sometimes make mistakes. It is more important to focus on the big picture of what he is saying than being bogged down by details or transcribing the board. This being said, if there are any mistakes or if something is unclear, don't be afraid to speak up--the professor is always eager to help students. Additionally, I highly recommend going to the homework parties. Particle physics is a very deep and complex subject, and the professor and TAs will help break down concepts intuitively. Finally, a note about the prerequisites: you do not need to have any knowledge of particle physics beforehand. However, you will need to know Einstein notation in the context of special relativity (you can learn this in PHYS 3327, a class in general relativity, or AEP 3200--somewhat; otherwise, the first chapter of Spacetime and Geometry by Sean Carroll should provide enough background), the basics of Lagrangian mechanics (PHYS 3318, AEP 3330), some basic quantum mechanics (PHYS 3316, AEP 3610), and perturbation theory (PHYS 3317, PHYS 4443, AEP 3620).
