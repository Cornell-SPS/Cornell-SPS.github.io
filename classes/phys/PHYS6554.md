## General Information
A continuation of PHYS 6553 and ASTRO 6509 that covers a variety of advanced topics and applications of general relativity in astrophysics, cosmology, and high-energy physics.


## Prerequisites

PHYS 6553 or permission of instructor.

## Topics Covered

  - Black hole thermodynamics
  - Other advanced topics in black hole physics such as rotation, perturbations, merger and ringdown, superradiance, singularity theorems, and properties of the horizon.
  - de Sitter and anti-de Sitter spacetimes
  - The mathematics of hypersurfaces and geodesic congruences
  - Energy and the Hamiltonian in GR

## Workload
  - ~5-15hours/week
  - 10 Problem sets
  - A final presentation


## General Advice


## Testimonials

Very fun. We covered Hawking radiation at the end, but the topics vary year to year. This course is easier than PHYS 6553 General Relativity I.
