<link rel="stylesheet" href="/main.css">

## General Information

A broad, graduate level view of statistical mechanics, with applications to not only physics and chemistry, but to computation, mathematics, dynamical and complex systems, and biology. Some traditional focus areas will not be covered in detail (thermodynamics, phase diagrams, perturbative methods, interacting gasses and liquids).  


## Prerequisites

 A high level of sophistication, equivalent to but not necessarily the same as that of a first-year physics graduate student (undergrad-level quantum, classical mechanics, and thermodynamics).
