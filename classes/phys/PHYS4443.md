## General Information

Provides an introduction to concepts and techniques of quantum mechanics, at the level of An Introduction to Quantum Mechanics by Griffiths.

## Prerequisites

PHYS 3316, and PHYS 3317, or PHYS 3327, or appropriate mathematics course(s), coregistration in PHYS 3318 ,or permission of instructor. Assumes prior experience in linear algebra, differential equations, and Fourier transforms.

## Topics Covered

  - Formalism (Hilbert Spaces, Inner Products, Hermitian/Unitary/Projection Operators, Measurement, Postulates of QM, Discrete Eigenstates and Eigenvalues, Time Evolution, Basis Representations, Compatible Observables, Operators with Continuous Spectra, Uncertainty Principle, Conjugate Variables)
  - Schrodinger Equation in 3D (Spherically-symmetric Potentials, Spherical Harmonics, the Radial Equation, the Hydrogen Atom, 3D harmonic oscillator,  Angular Momentum Algebra, Spin Algebra, Addition of Angular Momentum, Clebsch-Gordon madness)
  - Multiple Particles (Fermions/Bosons, Symmetric/Anti-Symmetric Wave Functions, Bloch's Theorem, Baby Band Structure, Spin Statistics, the Helium Atom, the Periodic Table, the H2 molecule)
  - Symmetries and Conservation Laws (conserved quantities, parity, translation, rotation, selection rules, degeneracy)  
  - Time-Independent Perturbation Theory (first & second order non-degenerate perturbation theory, first order degenerate perturbation theory, Hydrogenic fine structure)
  - Variational Principle (Helium Atom, H2 molecule ion)
  - WKB (the WKB approximation, tunneling, connection formulas)
  - Scattering (partial wave analysis, Born approximation)
  - Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory (2-level systems, transition probabilities, the Adiabatic Approximation, Absorption/Emission)
