## General Information

First course in the honors introductory physics sequence. Either this or PHYS 1112 is required for all physics majors. 
PHYS 1110 is a required corequisite.

## Prerequisites

Calculus II credit (AP Calculus BC, MATH 1910, MATH 1120, or equivalent).

## Topics Covered

  - Coordinate Systems
  - Kinematics
  - Dynamics
  - Conservation laws
  - Central force fields
  - Periodic motion
  - Special relativity

## Workload

A lot, especially since this is usually the first college-level physics class physics majors take. Weekly quizzes and problem sets, with one problem a week
being a "write up" problem. 3 lectures, 2 discussion sections, and 1 lab section per week.

## General Advice

  - Don't underestimate your abilities! This class is meant to be hard, but if you work at it, then it will start to become manageable
  - Don't leave the problem sets until the last minute, you'll make mistakes
  - Form a study group with students in class
