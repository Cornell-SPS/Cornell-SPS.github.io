# Astro Classes

Physics and Astrophysics majors are very closely related, as they share many of the same courses. Many Physics majors will concentrate in Astronomy, or do Astronomy research, so ASTRO classes are very popular in the major. 

Note that many upper level astronomy courses are cross listed with physics courses, such as Introduction to General Relativity
