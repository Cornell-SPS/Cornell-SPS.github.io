<link rel="stylesheet" href="../main.css">

## General Information

Builds off of PHYS 3316 and goes into how quantum mechanics applies into more specific subfields of physics, such as atomic physics, solid state physics, particle physics, nuclear physics, quantum statistics, etc. It doesn't introduce any new formalism or many new concepts apart from what was in PHYS 3316.

## Prerequisites

PHYS 3316

## Topics Covered

  - Physics of single and multi-electron atoms
  - Introduction to quantum statistics
  - Band theory of solids
  - Superconductivity
  - Nuclear structure
  - Elementary particle physics

## Workload

Weekly problems sets. 2 lectures and 1 discussion section per week. 3 prelims and no final exam. Towards the end of the semester, you will write a 4-page final report of an application of quantum mechanics not covered already in class.
