## General Information

A core math class. Either this or an equivalent multivariable class is required for all physics majors. This is a large class and generally people find it pretty tough, especially since a lot of the class involves visualizing things in 3-D. However, you will be applying the theorems in this class a lot in futue physics classes, so it's important to get comfortable with the course material.

## Prerequisites

MATH 1910 or AP Calc BC credit. You can take the CASE exam to test out of MATH 1910 if you didn't score high enough on the AP Calc BC exam.

## Topics Covered

  - Partial derivatives
  - Double and triple integrals
  - Line and surface integrals
  - Vector fields
  - Green's theorem
  - Stokes' theorem
  - Divergence theorem

## Workload

Weekly problem sets. 

## General Advice

  - Go to office hours
  - Form a study group with people in the class.
