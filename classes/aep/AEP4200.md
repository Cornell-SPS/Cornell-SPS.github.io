## General Information

Covers Fourier and Laplace transforms, ordinary and partial differential equations, separation of variables, Method of Frobenius, Laplace transform techniques. Green's functions, wave and diffusion equations, Solutions to Laplace's Equation, Hermitian Operators, Sturm-Liouville operators, Bessel functions, Legendre Polynomials, spherical harmonics.

## Prerequisites

Prerequisite: AEP 3200.

## Topics Covered



## Workload

Weekly problem sets, two prelims, and a final. [Fall 2023]

## General Advice

  - Read the textbook. It is very useful for doing the problem sets. Take advantage of TA office hours, as there are many helpful tricks and insights you can gain from them. [Fall 2023]

## Testimonials

The problem sets are generally not that long (with the exception of one or two), so the workload is manageable. However, the lectures can be a bit slow and behind the homeworks, so the textbook is a more reliable resource for learning the material. In terms of content, AEP 4200 will introduce some pretty useful concepts to your toolbox, some of which you may be able to find in a differential equations class, but others which you will likely only see in physics classes (thus making it useful to have some prior exposure through the math phys class).
